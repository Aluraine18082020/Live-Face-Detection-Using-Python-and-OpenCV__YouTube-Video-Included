# Live-Face-Detection-Using-Python-and-OpenCV

#### This project is about live detecting faces, eyes, and smiles from the laptop webcam using Python and OpenCV.

## Firstly, the OpenCV library was installed following a tutorial [1] then using the command:
###  pip install opencv-python
  
  
  
  
## Then, the code was written in Python after importing cv2 from the OpenCV library

 ### Casecade classifers for face, smile and eyes were downloaded from the openCV github page [2].
 
 

## Finally, the result is shown in the video:
